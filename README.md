# SQL-ETL-Data Wrangling
 
In this Project, I have performed SQL queries in SQL Server Management Studio to explore and analyze the data to gain insights. It consists of Nashville Housing Data where data is badly structured and requires a lot to be cleaned. The flow of the queries is from basic intermediate to advanced where I have Standardize Date Format, changing data type of SaleDate column from datetime data type to date data type, populated properly Address Column, Breaking out PropertyAddress into individual columns(Address, city, state), Breaking out OwnerAddress into individual columns(Address, city, state), Change Y and N to Yes and No in SoldAsVacant column. After performing queries, we analyze the output to further use the data for visualization and gain insights.

The data can be found in Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning.xlsx and the queries are saved in SQLQueries2.sql.
